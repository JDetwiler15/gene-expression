## Gene Expression in the Human Brain

The Allen Center for Brain Science has created and made available some 
[unique neuroscience datasets][1]. This project will analyse a comprehensive 
[dataset of gene expression in cells in medial temporal gyrus][2] of brain 
slices from multiple human donors. For each donor, this dataset uses a 
technique called RNA-sequencing to measure the expression level of every gene. 
The project will integrate these data with interaction networks among human 
proteins to understand the different biological processes that are active in 
this region of the brain. The project will entail learning new algorithms and 
computational ideas that we did not have time to delve into in the class.
